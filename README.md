**Author**: Abbey, Alex, Ollie
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)
## Overview
We know users want to be able to type in a location, receive an interactive map showing the location, and also receive the forecast for the next eight days.

We developed a back-end framework that queries geodata and weather apis. The framework returns the data via a front-end website. 

## Getting Started

— User needs to get their own API keys for Google Maps and DarkSky
— Front-end URL: https://alchemycodelab.github.io/city-explorer-front-end/
— User would need to copy over public code files.
— User needs to install dependencies: express, cors, and dotenv
— User also needs to install dev dependencies: eslint and nodemon
— User should set up scripts: lint, test, start, and start:watch

## Architecture

This is a back-end server framework deployed by Heroku. It is written with JavaScript using Node.js and various install npm files. This app also leverages various APIs from DarkSky and Google.
